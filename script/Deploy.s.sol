/**
 * @title DeployYieldSpace
 * @notice Deploys YieldSpace deterministically to any chain with a Uniswap v4 `PoolManager`.
 *
 * @dev A v4 hook only works at an address whose low fourteen bits spell out the callbacks it implements, so the
 * deployment starts by mining a CREATE2 salt. Mining against `Chains.CREATE2_DEPLOYER` makes the result
 * reproducible: anyone can re-run this script and derive the same address without trusting a published one.
 *
 * The address is not the same on every chain, because the hook takes its `PoolManager` as a constructor argument
 * and that changes the init code. What is guaranteed is that the address is a pure function of (source, compiler
 * settings, chain).
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *   forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_URL                       # dry run, sends nothing
 *   forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_URL --broadcast --verify  # for real
 *
 * Salt mining is a view loop that never reaches the chain, but it does consume script gas; some chains need
 * `--gas-limit 30000000000` or it fails with `EvmError: OutOfGas` inside the miner.
 *
 * Requires `PRIVATE_KEY` in the environment (or `--account` / `--ledger`). Re-running is safe: a hook already
 * deployed at its mined address is reported and skipped rather than redeployed.

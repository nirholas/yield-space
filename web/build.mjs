> ${hook.summary}

A production Uniswap v4 hook. Source: ${REPO}. Part of the HookForge catalogue: ${CATALOGUE}

## How it works
${hook.description}

## Prior art
${hook.priorArt}

## Where it does not help
${hook.limitation}

## Facts
Slug: ${hook.slug}
Contract: ${hook.contract}
Callbacks: ${Object.entries(hook.permissions ?? {}).filter(([, on]) => on).map(([n]) => n).join(", ") || "none"}
Parameters: ${(hook.configure?.fields ?? []).map((f) => f.name + " (" + f.type + ")").join(", ") || "none"}
Dynamic fee required: ${hook.properties?.dynamicFee ? "yes" : "no"}

## Caveats
- Unaudited.
- A deployment with status "deterministic" is a mined CREATE2 address with no code at it yet. Never present one as live.
